At one pole of my being I am one with stocks and stones. There I have to acknowledge the rule of *universal law*. That is where the foundation of my existence lies, deep down below. Its strength lies in its being held firm in the clasp of *comprehensive world*, and in the fullness of its community with all things.

But at the other pole of my being I am separate from all. There I have broken through the cordon of *equality* and stand alone as an *individual*. <mark>I am absolutely *unique*, I am I, I am *incomparable*.</mark> The whole weight of the universe cannot crush out this individuality of mine. I maintain it in spite of the tremendous gravitation of all things. It is small in appearance but great in reality. For it holds its own against the forces that would rob it of its distinction and make it one with the dust.

> We are absolutely bankrupt if we are deprived of this specialty, this individuality, which is the only thing we can call our own; and which, if lost, is also a loss to the whole world. 

It is most valuable because it is not universal. And therefore only through it can we gain the universe more truly than if we were lying within its breast unconscious of our distinctiveness. 

<mark>The universal is ever seeking its consummation in the unique</mark>. And the desire we have to keep our uniqueness intact is really the desire of the universe acting in us. It is our joy of the infinite in us that gives us our joy in ourselves.

Thus we find in perfect love the freedom of our self. That only which is done for love is done freely, however much pain it may cause. Therefore working for love is freedom in action. This is the meaning of the teaching of disinterested work in the *GÄ«ta*.

> It is the end of our self to seek that union. It must bend its head low in love and meekness and take its stand where great and small all meet. 

It has to gain by its loss and rise by its surrender. His games would be a horror to the child if he could not come back to his mother, and our pride of personality will be a curse to us if we cannot give it up in love. We must know that it is only the revelation of the *Infinite* which is endlessly new and eternally beautiful in us, and which gives the only meaning to our self.
