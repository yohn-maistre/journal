Things in which we do not take *joy* are either a burden upon our minds to be got rid of at any cost; or they are useful, and therefore in temporary and partial relation to us, becoming burdensome when their utility is lost; or they are like wandering vagabonds, loitering for a moment on the outskirts of our recognition, and then passing on. A thing is only completely our own when it is a thing of *joy* to us.

The greater part of this world is to us as if it were nothing. But we cannot allow it to remain so, for thus it belittles our own self. The entire world is given to us, and all our powers have their final meaning in the faith that by their help we are to take possession of our *patrimony*.

<mark>*Music* is the purest form of art, and therefore the most direct expression of *beauty*, with a form and spirit which is one and simple, and least encumbered with anything extraneous</mark>. We seem to feel that the manifestation of the infinite in the finite forms of creation is *music* itself, silent and visible. 

This world-song is never for a moment separated from its singer. It is not fashioned from any outward material. It is his *joy* itself taking never-ending form. It is the great heart sending the tremor of its thrill over the sky.

There is a perfection in each individual strain of this *music*, which is the revelation of completion in the incomplete. No one of its notes is final, yet each reflects the infinite.

> What does it matter if we fail to derive the exact meaning of this great harmony? Is it not like the hand meeting the string and drawing out at once all its tones at the touch?

It is the language of *beauty*, the caress, that comes from the heart of the world straightway reaches our heart.

<mark>Last night, in the silence which pervaded the darkness, I stood alone and heard the voice of the singer of eternal melodies</mark>. When I went to sleep I closed my eyes with this last thought in my mind, that even when I remain unconscious in slumber the dance of life will still go on in the hushed arena of my sleeping body, keeping step with the stars. The heart will throb, the blood will leap in the veins, and the millions of living atoms of my body will vibrate in tune with the note of the harp-string that thrills at the touch of the master.
